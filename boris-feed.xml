      <description>In the next version of Claude Code, Claude’s WebFetch tool automatically adds Accept: “text/markdown, *” to requests which helps docs sites provide token-efficient docs https://t.co/uYthd1m9RP

↩ @bunjavascript: When Claude Code fetches Bun’s docs, Bun’s docs now send markdown instead of HTML by default 

This shrinks token usage for our docs by about 10x https://t.co/cvasTo6h43</description>

Plugins are the easiest way to share and install bundles of agents, slash commands, MCP servers, and hooks.

Something we saw people doing already, now we made it even easier.

See Cat’s thread for details on auto-accept mode, auto-compact for context, and filepath autocomplete.

↩ @_catwu: Three more features for Claude Code today:

First, auto-accept mode.

Press Shift+Tab to toggle on auto-accept for file edits. This reduces friction while keeping you in the driver’s seat—you can tab in/out of auto-accept mode anytime. https://t.co/1WwoWbeWF2</description>
